  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  # 'dif' should be def.
  # Missing comma after card1
  dif highest_card(card1 card2)
  if card1.value > card2.value
  #card does not exist , should be card1
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
  #Keyword end should be after the last class method
end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  # total variable should be initialize total = 0
  total
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
  # the return should be outside the loop / missing to_s
    return "You have a total of" + total
  end
